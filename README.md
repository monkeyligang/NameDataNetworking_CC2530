A node, upon receiving an Interest packet, it will first checks the Content Store to find the matched Data packet with the Interest name and timestamp, if it exists the node returns the Data Packet on the interface from which the Interest came, otherwise, it will checks its PIT (Every node maintains a PIT, which states at each node supports recording each pending Interest, each item in the table corresponds to a distinct interest) to see if the Interest exists. If a matching PIT entry exists, the node simply updates the Incoming Interface of this Interest in this PIT. Finally, if no matching entry exists, this Interest will be sent to other neighbor nodes following FIB entries. This process will repeat when this node receives a new Interest. However, sometimes the user might send the same Interest to the network, in this case, the user will find the matching data content from the nearest node. 
When a sensor node receives a matching Interest, it response with a Data Packet including the userâ€™s requirement and desired data content. The source then forwards this packet to the down-stream interface listed in that PIT first entry, it then removes that PIT entry, and caches the Data in the CS
